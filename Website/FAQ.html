                <p class="lead text-left"><Strong class = "h4">How do I make a game?</Strong><br>
                <b>Step 1: </b>Schedule a meeting with your group members and figure out what roles you need, how you want to communicate, and figure out a base concept for the project. You should also figure out what everyone’s experience level is and what their key skills are to try and work to everyone’s strengths. 
                <br><br>Example roles are: Project Manager, Art Director, Lead Programmer and Writing Director.              
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 2: </b>Create a plan for what you want to create, assigning tasks and giving deadlines, and marking out clear dependencies for the project. You will also need to design what you want for the story/level, etc. You have a limited time span so try not to bite off more than you can chew, so try and limit what you want to do, e.g. only design 1 level or short snippet.
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 3: </b>Now its time for the team to work on the game. Do your best to keep to the plan, and regularly contact your teammates to keep them updated on your progress. If you’re having trouble, don’t be afraid to contact your team and the event runners. 
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 4: </b>Submit the game to the itch.io page in a playable format. This means the game needs to be compiled and shouldn’t require the player to have the platform it was developed on installed on their own computer.
